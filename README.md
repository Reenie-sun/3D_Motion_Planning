# 3D Motion Planning

The goal of his project is to plan and execute a trajectory through a 3D complex urban environment.

## Environment

The drone is situated in the middle of a map which represents downtown San Francisco. The drone should take off, plan a trajectory from its current position to a goal position in the map and execute the trajectory avoiding obstacles. That is known as the motion planning problem.

The environment is a continuous space, so we should discretize it into a grid or a graph representation to be able to search through it and find a path.

The complexity of the grid/graph representation is really important in the motion planning problem. A very complex representation will represent the environment precisely but it will take a lot to search and find a path. However, if the representation is very simple, we could miss or collide with obstacles.

## Grid Search

A grid-based representation of the environment is widely used and it can be searched using A* or other algorithms.

### 2D Grid

Instead of using the entire 3D environment, we can use a 2D grid for representing a certain altitude where the drone is going to fly.

For doing this, we can create a 2D configuration space of the environment given the obstacle data in `colliders.csv` and a safety distance that we would like to leave around obstacles.

The output should look something like this:

The left image shows the original map while the right image is the 2D representation at 5 meters altitude.

### 3D Grid

We can also represent the environment as a 3D grid or a 2.5D grid (limited altitude).

A 3D representation may be useful for representing a local map or small region instead of representing a global map.

However, we can change the resolution of the map to make it more or less complex depending on the situation.

Here we can see a 3D configuration space of the city with a resolution of 10 mÂ³:

With a 2D or 3D grid of the environment we can now search a path using [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) with an appropriate heuristic.

## Graphs

Graphs can also be used to discretize the world and represent the search space. A graph is a collection of nodes connected with edges so we can also plan a path that starts at a specific node and goes through the edges until a goal node.

For example, the road network is actually a graph where the intersections represent the nodes and the roads represent the edges.

### Voronoi diagram

[Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20Voronoi%20diagram,%2C%20sites%2C%20or%20generators) is a graph that breaks up the space into regions around a set of points representing obstacles so that all the points in a given region are closest to that obstacle.

We can create a graph given the edges of the Voronoi diagram where all of them represent feasible paths to navigate around obstacles and use A* algorithm to find a path from start to goal:

### Probabilistic roadmap

The [Probabilistic roadmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_roadmap) creates a graph representation of the free space in the environment sampling points at random and testing them for collision. These random samples are connected to form the roadmap (graph) that can then be searched to find a path from start to goal.

Here's an example of this graph representation after sampling 500 points:

## Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT)

[RRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree) is an algorithm that iteratively grows a tree from a starting position using random samples from the search space. Then, these samples are connected to the closest available node and checked for collisions.

A tree is a special case of a graph with directed edges and only with one path to any vertex.

Here's an example of a generated RRT:
